# optimized-marketing-site
Challenge Description: The developers were tasked with taking a website for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. that was already structurally and stylistically strong and refactoring the code for the purposes of efficiency and search engine optimization.

Changes Made: As a developer, I first ensured that so many of the "div" elements needed to be replaced with unique semantic HTML elements. Upon replacing many of these elements, the next task was to consolidate the numerous redundant styling elements on the CSS stylesheet into more manageable shared folders. Once this was done, a number of id and class changes were made to improve functionality of the site and operation of many of the links.
